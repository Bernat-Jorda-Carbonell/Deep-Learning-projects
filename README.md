# Deep-Learning-projects
Projects that I did to improve my coding skills and my understanding of certain topics. Some are from coursed courses projects and some from proposed projects I found online. In descending order of importance


## micro GPT
Using the supercomputer Snellius and a template, I implemented and trained my own version of GPT 2.0.

## MLPs and Backpropagation
Project to learn basics Multi Layer Perceptron, both with basic NumPy and with PyTorch

## CNNs
Two small projects with Convolution Neural Netwroks. In the first one
 
## Variational_Auto_Encoder
