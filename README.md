# Deep-Learning-projects
Projects that I did to improve my coding skills and my understanding of certain topics. Some are from coursed courses projects and some from proposed projects I found online. In descending order of importance


## micro GPT
Using the supercomputer Snellius and a template, I implemented and trained my own version of GPT 2.0. to get a good understanding of all the moving parts of the Attention mechanism and Large Language Models


## Variational_Auto_Encoder
My own VAE model trained on MNIST datset


## Adversarial attacks
An implementation of the FGSM and PGD attacks and tested them against a pretrained ResNet18 model


## CNNs
Two small projects with Convolution Neural Netwroks. In one, implemented and trained a cNN model over the CIFAR-10 dataset, and then implemented a rotation function to augmentate the data and train a different model to see the difference between the model trained with raw data and the one trained with data augmented with rotations.
In the other project, I tested different types on convolution and compared how they behaved to get a better understanding of the pros and cons of each convolution type. 
 
	
## MLPs and Backpropagation
Project to learn basics Multi Layer Perceptron, both with basic NumPy and with PyTorch
